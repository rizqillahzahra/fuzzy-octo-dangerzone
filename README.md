=====================

Java fuzzy logic controller! 

Initial version of the project contains 2 examples of a fuzzy logic controller.

1) A/C controller (for an apartment/house): This controller is currently built for a 1 bedroom apartment with 3 input sensors. Eventually, this project should be extensable to any number of rooms and input signals, by means of an externally loadable rule-base.
    
2) PC/Server fan controller
